# AoC2020
Advent of Code 2020. Sadly I lost 2019 and 2018 :(

# Day 1
 - Smart way - 2-pointer algorithm O(N) and second part 3-pointer algorithm O(N^2)
 - Bruteforce way - brute force O(N^2) and O(N^3), but it doesn't matter input is small

Files:
```
1-smart.py  
1-stupid.py  
2-smart.py  
2-stupid.py
```
# Day 2
Go through each line and check if it is valid, nothing special here

Files:

2.py
