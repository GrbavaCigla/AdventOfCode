# AoC2020
Advent of Code 2020. Sadly I lost 2019 and 2018 :(
C++ solutions by Maksim BjeliÄ‡.

## Day 1
 - Smart way - 2-pointer algorithm O(N) and second part 3-pointer algorithm O(N^2)
 - Bruteforce way - brute force O(N^2) and O(N^3), but it doesn't matter input is small

## Day 2
Go through each line and check if it is valid, nothing special here

## Day 3
Skip first y lines (y is steps down) with steps y like this:
```python
new_lines = lines[y::y]
```
Loop through `new_lines` and add x to counter (x is steps right, counter is current x coordinate)
```python
xcount += x
```
And next check if there is a tree
```python
current_spot = line[xcount % limit]
ans += 1 if current_spot == "#" else 0
```
And that should be it, everything else is easy.
